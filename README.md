The Deebs Ecommerce Platform is a platform that offers credit to users at the point of checkout. The platform makes it possible for users lacking funds to make purchase online for things they need and pay instalment using a range of flexible plans. 

The platforms works this way:

User opens the website and selects an item to buy from the shop.

User decides if he/she wants to pay immediately or pay later.

If the user picks the "pay later" option, he/she will be taken to a KYC page to fill in details.

After submition, the details will be reviewed under 24 hours and an email will be sent to the user if he or she qualifies to get credit to purchase that product.
